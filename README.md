# Yo-Yo-Store
A fake yo-yo showcase site that I made to polish up my skills for the MEAN stack. Combined Angular 5 front-end with my Node server, Express back-end, and MongoDB for my database. Made a REST API that displayed, added, updated, and deleted yo-yos from my Angular interface to my database. Also used Bootstrap for the design.
