  "description": "A yo-yo showcase site that I made to polish up my skills for the MEAN stack. Combined Angular 5 front-end with a Node server, Express back-end, and MongoDB for my database. Made a REST API that displayed, added, updated, and deleted yo-yos from my Angular interface to my database. Also used Bootstrap, responsiveness, and various animations for the design.",
